# DualShot fps-cadence — Findings & Runbook

**Harness:** `perf/dualshot-fps-diagnosis` (CadenceProbe/CadenceStats + DEBUG taps).
**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-29-dualshot-fps-cadence-diagnosis-design.md`
**Device:** RZCYA1VBQ2H. Build: `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug` then `adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

## Log filters (PowerShell)

```powershell
adb logcat -c
adb logcat -s RovaLog:* | Select-String "EglRouter cadence","EglEncoder","DualShot AE"
```

`EglRouter cadence` → cameraHW vs wallArrival median/p95 (the §4 discriminator).
`EglEncoder[PORTRAIT|LANDSCAPE] cadence` → consume / service / swap / total + mailboxDrops (logged at record stop).
`DualShot AE` → exposure ceiling / frameDuration / aeTargetFpsRange / aeState (best-effort).

## Test matrix (run each ≥2 segments, discard first ~30 warm-up frames)

| # | Light | Preview | AE pin | Purpose |
|---|-------|---------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Bright | Foreground | none | baseline + does cadence rise when bright? |
| 2 | Dim | Foreground | none | AE light-dependence |
| 3 | Bright | Headless | none | isolate callback-thread preview-swap overrun |
| 4 | Dim | Foreground | [30,30] one-off | direct AE test (probe-only, reverted) |

Capture merged-MP4 `stts` fps each run as the external cross-check (same method as #152).

## Discriminator (spec §4)

- cameraHW median ≈ 50ms AND wallArrival ≈ 50ms → **capture/AE-side**.
- cameraHW ≈ 33ms BUT wallArrival ≈ 50ms → **consumer-side** (callback overrun or encoder backpressure).
  - Then: encoder `total(take→swap)` ≈ 50ms with high mailboxDrops → **encoder backpressure**; else callback service time dominates → **callback overrun**.
- Report per-stage distributions; call out the dominant limiter AND any near-tie (compound cause), do not force one bucket.

### Per-stage breakdown (Run 1)

| Stage | Median | Implied fps | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| Camera HW (`getTimestamp` delta) | **60.0 ms** | **16.7** | the ceiling — sensor cadence |
| Wall arrival (`nanoTime` delta) | 58.8 ms | 17.0 | equals HW delta → no consumer stretch |
| Callback render (`renderTotal`) | 1.6 ms | (cheap) | idle-bound, not a limiter |
| Encoder consume | 60.0 ms | 16.7 | matches camera exactly |
| Encoder service (`take→finish`) | 38 ms | (~26 cap) | could do ~26fps; waits idle for frames |
| Encoder swap (`finish→swap`) | 1.3 ms | — | no MediaCodec backpressure |
| Encoder total (`take→swap`) | 39 ms | (~25 cap) | ≪ 60 ms arrival |
| Mailbox drops | **0** | — | no frames dropped per side |
| AE exposure time | **60.0 ms** | **16.7** | = frame duration; AE CONVERGED |

### Verdict — COMPOUND (two stacked limiters), proven by intervention

The dim run named AE; the bright run (falsification test) **confirmed AE AND uncovered a second ceiling that AE had been masking.**

**Limiter 1 — CAPTURE-SIDE / AUTO-EXPOSURE (primary, binds in typical/dim light).**
- Run 1 (dim): cameraHW delta 60ms == wallArrival 59ms == encoder consume 60ms == AE `SENSOR_EXPOSURE_TIME` 60ms, `AE_STATE=CONVERGED`, range `[15,30]`. Four independent clocks agree to ≤1ms → the sensor delivers 16.7fps because AE stretched exposure to 60ms to gather light.
- Run 2 (bright): identical binding, scene flooded with light → AE dropped exposure **60ms → 3.27ms**, frameDuration fell to the 30fps cap (33.3ms), and **cameraHW rose to 33.3ms = 30.0fps**. The fps moved with light exactly as predicted. This is a controlled-intervention proof that capture cadence is exposure-bound, not a fixed pipeline limit.

**Limiter 2 — ENCODER SERVICE TIME (secondary, was hidden behind Limiter 1).**
- In Run 1 the encoder was idle-bound (`total=39ms ≪ 60ms` arrival, `mailboxDrops=0`) — it could easily keep up with a starved 16.7fps camera.
- In Run 2, with the camera genuinely delivering 30fps, the encoder's GPU service time (`take→finish ≈ 45ms`, dominated by `drawFrame`+`glFinish`) caps it at **~21–22fps**, and the latest-wins mailbox **drops 25–33 frames per side per segment**. Swap (`finish→swap ≈ 1.3ms`) is NOT the stall — it's the GPU sample/draw (`glFinish`).

**Net:** the historical `~18–20fps` plateau is **AE-limited in normal/dim light** (the usual case), but once AE is lifted the **encoder's ~45ms service time becomes the next wall at ~22fps**. They are stacked, not either/or — and the harness's per-stage distributions made the second one visible the moment the first was removed (spec §7: report compound causes, don't collapse to one bucket).

**Confidence:** High for both. Limiter 1 is proven by direct AE metadata + a light intervention that moved fps 16.7→30. Limiter 2 is proven by 30fps camera input + 45ms encoder service + 25–33 mailbox drops in the same run.

### Candidate fix → follow-up spec

This is now a **two-part** fix, and order matters — fixing only AE would surface the encoder gate (output would land ~22fps with frame drops, not 30):

1. **Floor the AE fps range** (`Camera2Interop … CONTROL_AE_TARGET_FPS_RANGE`, e.g. `[30,30]` or `[24,30]` vs the device `[15,30]`). Lifts Limiter 1. **Quantified tradeoff:** caps exposure at ~33ms vs the 60ms AE wants in dim scenes → ~½ the light per frame → darker/noisier low-light video. Options: flat floor, brightness-adaptive floor, or a user "smoothness vs low-light" preference.
2. **Reduce encoder service time** (Limiter 2). The ~45ms `take→finish` is the GPU draw + `glFinish` per side. Candidates for the fix spec to investigate: removing/relaxing the per-frame `glFinish` (rely on the existing fence-sync chain instead of a hard CPU stall), cheaper per-side draw, or revisiting the single-`CameraEffect` fan-out topology (the spec's gated escalation). **NOTE:** the encoder `service` rose 38ms (Run 1) → 45ms (Run 2); confirm whether that's the higher frame rate saturating the GPU vs thermal accumulation across back-to-back sessions before committing a fix.

Fix = **separate brainstorm → spec → plan**, gated on this verdict. No code change in this slice. The probe should stay (DEBUG-gated) through the fix cycle to measure each step, then be removed before the fix PR per spec §5.

## AE floor — device verification (Limiter 1 fix, ADR-0034)

**Shipped:** `AeFpsRangePolicy` (capability-gated, brightness-preferring fallback) + `applyAeFpsFloor` (intersect AE ranges across matched back cameras) + 47th gate `checkAeFpsRangeCapabilityGated`. SDD slice on `perf/dualshot-fps-diagnosis`.

**Device:** RZCYA1VBQ2H, SD · DualShot, dim/indoor, 2×10s.

### First device run (pre-fix) — FAILED, feature inert
- `AE floor: selector resolved 2 cameras (need 1), skipping` (logged every binding). `DEFAULT_BACK_CAMERA` resolves to multiple physical back cameras (dumpsys: 6 back), so the original `matches.size != 1` identity guard skipped the apply.
- Effective `aeTargetFpsRange` stayed `[15, 30]`.
- Device fps-range data (every back camera, identical): `(15,15)(15,20)(20,20)(24,24)(15,30)(30,30)` — **no true `[24,30]`**. The original "prefer highest upper" policy would have returned `(30,30)` (pins 30fps, darkest dim) even once applied.

### Fix (codex-reconciled, owner-approved)
1. Identity guard → **intersect** `CONTROL_AE_AVAILABLE_TARGET_FPS_RANGES` across all matched back cameras (no pre-bind API names the bound winner; the intersection is safe whichever binds). Skip only on 0 matches / empty intersection.
2. Policy → prefer a **true ceiling-spanning range** (`upper==ceiling && lower>=floor && lower<upper`); else the **lowest pinned fps ≥ floor** (brightness). On this device → `(24,24)`; on a device exposing real `[24,30]` → `[24,30]`.

### Second device run (post-fix) — PASS
```
AE floor: requested CONTROL_AE_TARGET_FPS_RANGE=[24, 24]    (both bindings, no "skipping")
DualShot AE: exposure=40000000ns (~25fps ceiling) frameDuration=41666000ns (~24fps) aeTargetFpsRange=[24, 24] aeState=2(CONVERGED)
EglRouter cadence [60f]: cameraHW median=41.7 p95=41.7 (~24.0fps) | wallArrival median≈40.5 (~24.8fps)
EglEncoder[PORTRAIT/LANDSCAPE] cadence: consume median≈45.9 (~21.8fps) | service(take→finish)≈43ms | swap≈1.3ms | mailboxDrops=2
```

**Outcome:**
- **Floor applied + honored:** effective `aeTargetFpsRange=[24,24]` (was `[15,30]`). Concern C resolved — the `Preview.Builder` Camera2Interop option **propagates through the `CameraEffect(PREVIEW)` fan-out** (the live session reflects the requested range).
- **Limiter 1 fixed:** dim `cameraHW` held at **41.7ms / 24.0fps** (steady). The same class of dim scene collapsed to ~60ms / 16.7fps pre-fix (diagnosis Run 1). AE wanted longer exposure (40ms, would have gone lower-fps) but the floor pinned 24fps — the intended cadence-over-brightness tradeoff.
- **Limiter 2 unchanged (expected):** encoder service ~43ms still caps **output ~22fps**; merged-file fps stays encoder-gated until the deferred Limiter 2 cycle. Camera-side success criterion met.
- Camera opened cleanly (preview visible, no session-config error).
